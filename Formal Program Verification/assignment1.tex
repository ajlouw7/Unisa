\section{Question 1}

If A is a knight he would have siad he is a knight. If A is a knave he would have said he is a knight. Thus no matter what A is he would have said a knight. That means B heard him say he was a knight. Thus B is a knave since he lied about being A saying he is a knight. C said B was lying and B was lying. Thus C is a knight. We cannot detemine what A is since he would always say he is knight. B and C only responded based on what A said and not on what they know A to be.
