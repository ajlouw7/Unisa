@article{Lee2013,
abstract = {a b s t r a c t The Systematised Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) has been designated as the rec-ommended clinical reference terminology for use in clinical information systems around the world and is reported to be used in over 50 countries. However, there are still few implementation details. This study examined the implementation of SNOMED CT in terms of design, use and maintenance issues involved in 13 healthcare organisations across eight countries through a series of interviews with 14 individuals. While a great deal of effort has been spent on developing and refining SNOMED CT, there is still much work ahead to bring SNOMED CT into routine clinical use.},

@article{subset,
abstract = {This paper describes the development of a SNOMED CT subset derived from clinical notes. A corpus of 44 million words of patient progress notes was drawn from the clinical information system of the Intensive Care Service (ICS) at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia. This corpus was processed by a variety of natural language processing procedures including the computation of all SNOMED CT candidate codes. There are about 13 million concept instances comprising about 30,000 unique concept types detected in the corpus. These instances have been processed by a tool which computes the closure of the minimal sub-tree of concept types in the SNOMED hierarchy thus inferring the complete subset of SNOMED CT that would be necessary for an intensive care unit. A subset of about 2700 concepts gives a coverage of 96{\%} of the corpus and the transitive closure uses less than 1{\%} of SNOMED concepts and relationships. Use of this subset will enable clinical information systems to efficiently deliver SNOMED CT terminology to the presentation interface.},

abstract = {Over a period of 40 years, SNOMED has developed from a pathology-specific nomenclature (SNOP) into a logic-based health care terminology. In spite of its long existence and continuous evolvement, it is yet unknown to what extent SNOMED is used in clinical practice, and what benefits were achieved. The aim of this paper is to investigate this by providing an overview of published studies in which a version of SNOMED was studied or applied.},

However, its use for intelligent services based on formal reasoning is questionable.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The analysis of the structure of SNOMED CT is based on the formal top-level ontology DOLCE.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The analysis revealed several ontological and knowledge-engineering errors, the most important are errors in the hierarchy (mostly from an ontological point of view, but also regarding medical aspects) and the mixing of subsumption relations with other types (mostly 'part of').$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The found errors impede formal reasoning. The paper presents a possible way to correct these problems.},

abstract = {SNOMED International is working on a query language specifica-tion for SNOMED CT, which we call here SCTQL. SNOMED CT is the leading terminology for use in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). SCTQL can con-tribute to effective retrieval and reuse of clinical information within EHRs. This paper analyses the functional capabilities needed for SCTQL and proposes two implementations that rely on ontological representations of SNOMED CT: one based on the W3C SPARQL 1.1 query language and another based on the OWL API. The paper reports the performance and correctness of both imple-mentations as well as highlights their benefits and drawbacks.},
