abstract = {In this paper we discuss the development and application of a large formal ontology to the semantic web. The Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) (Niles Pease, 2001) (SUMO, 2002) is a "starter document" in the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology effort. This upper ontology is extremely broad in scope and can serve as a semantic foundation for search, interoperation, and communication on the semantic web.},

abstract = {The KaDo case, designed for either an advanced undergraduate AIS class or a graduate AIS class, has four parts: enterprise modeling, relational database design, integration of legacy systems, and information retrieval. The first part exposes students to advanced enterprise modeling concepts such as subtypes and advanced REA concepts such as policy specifications. The second part asks students to translate advanced modeling concepts such as subtypes into relational database structures. The objective of the third part is for students to learn how to use database software to integrate legacy systems. Their task involves two steps: importing data and integrating data. The fourth part involves information retrieval where students map information requirements into queries that can be executed by the computer. The advanced query techniques that students apply include multi-column join definitions, union, and view hierarchies. KaDo is a dynamic case that allows instructors to create a version of the case adapted to their own learning objectives. KaDo's Web Environment (KWE) further enables them to create and deliver case materials online. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Numerous research groups are now utilizing Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as an upper-level framework to assist in the organization and integration of biomedical information. This paper provides elucidation of the three BFO categories of function, role, and disposition, and considers two proposed sub-categories of artifactual function and bio-logical function. The motivation is to help advance the coherent treatment of functions, roles, and dispositions, to help provide the potential for more detailed classification, and to shed light on BFOs general structure and use.},

abstract = {Several foundational ontologies have been developed recently. We examine two of these from the point of view of their quality in representing temporal changes, focusing on the example of roles. We discuss how these are modelled in two foundational ontologies: the Unified Foundational Ontology and the BORO foundational ontology. These exhibit two different approaches, endurantist and perdurantist respectively. We illustrate the differences using a running example in the university student domain, wherein one individual is not only a registered student but also, for part of this period, was elected the President of the Student Union. The metaphysical choices made by UFO and BORO lead to different representations of roles. Two key differences which affect the way roles are modelled are exemplified in this paper: (1) different criteria of identity and (2) differences in the way individual objects extend over time and possible worlds. These differences impact upon the quality of the models produced in terms of their respective explanatory power. The UFO model concentrates on the notion of validity in " all possible worlds " and is unable to accurately represent the way particulars are extended in time. The perdurantist approach is best able to describe temporal changes wherein roles are spatio-temporal extents of individuals.},

@article{J.F.Allen1984,
abstract = {The concept of action arises in at least two major subareas of artificial intelligence, namely, natural language processing and problem solving. For the most part, the formalisms that have been suggested in each subarea are independent of each other and difficult to com-pare, although there is recent work that attempts to merge work from both areas (Charniak 1981). Even considering such work, however, there is presently no computational theory of action that is sufficiently powerful to capture the range of the meanings and distinctions expressible in English. The primary goal of this paper is to suggest a formalism that is considerably more expressive than current theories of action and to explore its use in defining the meanings of English sentences that describe actions and events. A secondary, but important, requirement on the formalism is that it should be a useful representation for action reasoning (i.e., problem solving). Some effort will be made to describe how the representation could be used by a planning or plan recognition system. This is essential to the natural language research as well, because problem-solving techniques are being used more and more in our models of language comprehension (e.g., see Allen and Perrault 1980). While interest in this approach is growing, progress is inhibited by inadequate representations of actions and plans. There are at least three major difficulties with nearly all existing models of action in AI. Such models cannot represent: – actions that involve non-activity (e.g., ''I stood on the corner for an hour''); – actions that are not easily decomposable into subactions (e.g., ''I spent the day hiding from George''); – actions that occur simultaneously and interact with many others. The theory outlined below will allow all three of these situations to be represented. Each problem will be examined in detail below when discussing previous work.},

@article{Smith1996,
abstract = {The paper is a contribution to formal ontology. It seeks to use topological means in order to derive ontological laws pertaining to the boundaries and interiors of wholes, to relations of contact and connectedness, to the concepts of surface, point, neighbourhood, and so on. The basis of the theory is mereology, the formal theory of part and whole, a theory which is shown to have a number of advantages, for ontological purposes, over standard treatments of topology in set-theoretic terms. One central goal of the paper is to provide a rigorous formulation of Brentano's thesis to the effect that a boundary can exist as a matter of necessity only as part of a whole of higher dimension of which it is the boundary. It concludes with a brief survey of current applications of mereotopology in areas such as natural-language analysis, geographic information systems, machine vision, naive physics, and database and knowledge engineering.},
