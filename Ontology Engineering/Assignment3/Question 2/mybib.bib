abstract = {In this paper we discuss the development and application of a large formal ontology to the semantic web. The Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) (Niles Pease, 2001) (SUMO, 2002) is a "starter document" in the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology effort. This upper ontology is extremely broad in scope and can serve as a semantic foundation for search, interoperation, and communication on the semantic web.},

abstract = {The KaDo case, designed for either an advanced undergraduate AIS class or a graduate AIS class, has four parts: enterprise modeling, relational database design, integration of legacy systems, and information retrieval. The first part exposes students to advanced enterprise modeling concepts such as subtypes and advanced REA concepts such as policy specifications. The second part asks students to translate advanced modeling concepts such as subtypes into relational database structures. The objective of the third part is for students to learn how to use database software to integrate legacy systems. Their task involves two steps: importing data and integrating data. The fourth part involves information retrieval where students map information requirements into queries that can be executed by the computer. The advanced query techniques that students apply include multi-column join definitions, union, and view hierarchies. KaDo is a dynamic case that allows instructors to create a version of the case adapted to their own learning objectives. KaDo's Web Environment (KWE) further enables them to create and deliver case materials online. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},
