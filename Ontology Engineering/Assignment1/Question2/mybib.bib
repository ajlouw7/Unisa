@article{Decker,
abstract = {T he World Wide Web is possible because a set of widely established standards guarantees interoperability at various levels. Until now, the Web has been designed for direct human processing, but the next-generation Web, which Tim Berners-Lee and others call the " Seman-tic Web, " aims at machine-processible information. 1 The Semantic Web will enable intelligent services such as information brokers, search agents, and information filters, which offers greater functionality and interoper-ability than current stand-alone services. The Semantic Web will only be possible once further levels of interop-erability have been established. Standards must be defined not only for the syntactic form of documents, but also for their semantic content. Notable among recent W3C standardization efforts are XML/XML schema and RDF/RDF schema, which facilitate semantic interoperability. In this article, we explain the role of ontologies in the architecture of the Semantic Web. We then briefly summarize key elements of XML and RDF, showing why using XML as a tool for semantic interoperability will be ineffective in the long run. We argue that a further representation and inference layer is needed on top of the Web's current layers, and to estab-lish such a layer, we propose a general method for encoding ontology rep-resentation languages into RDF/RDF schema. We illustrate the extension method by applying it to OIL, an ontology representation and inference language.},
