@article{rumel,
abstract = {We describe a new learning procedure, back-propagation, for networks of neurone-like units. The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vecotr of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal 'hidden' units wich are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpoler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure.},

@article{harik,
abstract = {This paper presents a model to predict the convergence quality of genetic algorithms based on the size of the population. The model is based on an analogy between selection in GAs and one-dimensional random walks. Using the solution to a classic random walk problem-the gambler's ruin-the model naturally incorporates previous knowledge about the initial supply of building blocks (BBs) and correct selection of the best BB over its desired quality of the solution, as well as the problem size and difficulty. The accuracy of the model is verified with experiments using additively decomposable functions of varying difficulty. The paper demonstrates how to adjust the model to account for noise present in the fitness evaluation and for different tournament sizes.},

abstract = {In this paper we present some theoretical and empirical results on the interacting roles of population size and crossover in genetic algorithms. We summarize recent theoretical results on the disruptive effect of two forms of multi-point crossover: n-point crossover and uniform crossover. We then show empirically that disruption analysis alone is not sufficient for selecting appropriate forms of crossover. However , by taking into account the interacting effects of population size and crossover, a general picture begins to emerge. The implications of these results on implementation issues and performance are discussed, and several directions for further research are suggested.},

@techreport{Lipowski2011,
abstract = {Roulette-wheel selection is a frequently used method in genetic and evolutionary algorithms or in modeling of complex networks. Existing routines select one of N individuals using search algorithms of O(N) or O(log N) complexity. We present a simple roulette-wheel selection algorithm, which typically has O(1) complexity and is based on stochastic acceptance instead of searching. We also discuss a hybrid version, which might be suitable for highly heterogeneous weight distributions, found, for example, in some models of complex networks. With minor modifications, the algorithm might also be used for sampling with fitness cutoff at a certain value or for sampling without replacement.},
